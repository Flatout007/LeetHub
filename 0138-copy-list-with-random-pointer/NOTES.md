**The main idea of this algorithm is to create a new copy of a linked list that has both next and random pointers, using a HashMap to keep track of the already visited nodes. The getClonedNode method creates a new node for a given original node if it hasn't been visited before, and returns the cloned node. The copyRandomList method starts by creating a new head node, adding it to the visited HashMap, and then iterates through the original list, cloning each node and updating the next and random pointers of the cloned nodes using the getClonedNode method. Finally, it returns the cloned head node.**
