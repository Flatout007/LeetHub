## 1. ðŸ”¬ Define an `expand` method that takes in `left` and `right` indices and returns the length of the longest palindrome centered at the given indices:
- Set `L` to `left` and `R` to `right`.
- While `L` is greater than or equal to 0 and `R` is less than the length of `s`, and `s[L]` equals `s[R]`, decrement `L` and increment `R`.
- Return `R - L - 1`, which is the size of the palindrome.

## 2. ðŸ§­ Define a `longest` method that traverses through the input string `s` and calls the `expand` method with different indices to get the lengths of palindromes at those indices. It then updates `start` and `end` properties if it finds a longer palindrome:
- If `s` is null or has length less than 1, return an empty string.
- For each index `i` in `s`:
- Call `expand(i, i)` to get the length of a palindrome centered at `i`.
- Call `expand(i, i+1)` to get the length of a palindrome centered between `i` and `i+1`.
- Set `len` to the maximum of the two lengths.
- If `len` is greater than the current subarray window, update `start` and `end` indices to represent the middle and end of the current subarray string.
- Return the substring of `s` from `start` to `end + 1`.
